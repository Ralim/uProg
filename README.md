uProg

UART programming wrapper tool.
This integrates a _very_ basic serial port terminal, handling closing and opening the serial port around a programming tool.

When it is first run it will act as a serial port terminal viewer tool; but then running the programming command will close the viewer, and execute the programming command.
Once the programming command is finished, any key can be pressed to drop back into the serial port viewer.
